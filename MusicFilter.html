			<p>After high school, I worked as a phone salesman for Sprint. My manager was an 80's metalhead and my co-worker, Luke, was a metalcore type-of-guy. The store had low traffic (during the '08 financial crisis), so we spent a lot of time listening to metal, talking about metal, and air-guitaring. Well, one day, Luke showed me this band, 3 Inches of Blood. It was fast, aggressive, and the falsetto vocals were awesome and funny and fun! Also, he showed me the song "Destroy the Orcs". I'm a big Tolkein fan, so this was an extra fun song to find. </p>
			<p>Their first few albums are really great. I listened to this band a TON around my early 20's. I lost track of them as I got older, I got into black then death metal through my 20's and 30's, so I lost track of some of these really awesome bands. Right now, in my mid-30's, I'm definitely interested in going back to some of these bands I haven't listened to in a long time.</p>

			<p>Absu are crazy. They started in the 90's as a doomy death metal band. Proscriptor McGovern joined, and they started becoming more thrashy and black metal-y. Not a Norwegian or European black metal, but an American version. It's very fast, very interesting, and very thrashy. Proscriptor is the drummer and vocalist. Proscriptor uses insane black metal vocals while drumming extremely fast and quite technical. Their lyrical themes are mainly around Celtic and Sumerian mythology, and magick and occultism. "Absu" in Sumerian mythology refers to a subterranean ocean. The one word I think of when I think of Absu is "aggressive".</p>
			<p>I originally found Absu from YouTube back in 2009. I had not yet started delving into harsh vocals and black metal, but this band is one that opened that door for me. I was listening to a lot of Einherjer. I mainly liked their album "Odin Owns Ye All", which uses clean vocals. Their other albums, however, used black metal-type vocals. I listened to some of those EPs and albums, but I didn't yet open that harsh vocal door, completely. Well, back in '09, there was a video that kept popping up in my suggestion list. It was for Absu's music video "Manannan". The thumbnail was of the guitarist - it wasn't too interesting, but the name "Absu" and the song title intrigued me for some reason. That entire visual intrigued me, but for some reason I was apprehensive. Well, eventually my curious got the better of me, and I clicked the video! I suppose if you see a suggested video constantly, eventually you're going to click it lol.</p>
			<p>I remember watching it late at night on my laptop while I was in bed. It was a music video, but I was so confused when I saw (who I think might be an actor?) with the facepaint and performing the vocals, but I also saw the drummer screaming the vocals in several shots. I liked it, but I was more fascinated with the band's image and the drummer's craziness than I was the music. I eventually listened to their most-famous record, "Tara", and a few songs completely captured me. After that, and as I slowly started devouring black metal and harsh vocals, I liked Absu more and more. </p>

			<p>I randomly was suggested this band from a buddy mid 2024. He sent me the album "In But Not Of". It turns out... I fell in love with the album! They're some kind of brutal death metal band from New York. I need to explore their earlier material, but this 2023 album has progressive elements, which is VERY interesting!

			<p>Many people categorize Amon Amarth as viking metal, but I'd say that they're technically melodic death metal - particularly the Gothenburg style. Their lyrical themes are around vikings, but their style of metal isn't necessarily viking metal.</p>
			<p>I can't remember when I found Amon Amarth; it must have been after my black metal phase and when I was getting more into death metal. In fact, I might have found them when their "Surtur Rising" album came out in 2011! I had heard of them for years and years, but hadn't given them a listen. That album cover looked pretty cool, and for some reason I bought it. I'm not sure if I listened to it on YouTube and bought it afterwards, but yeah, it is a great album. I particularly like the songs "Töck's Taunt: Loke's Treachery Part II" and "A Beast Am I".</p>
			<p>I think that AA are a lot like Slayer - they're a very consistent band who have not strayed from their original sound. I think that this is both a good and band thing. It's good because it's classic and reliable, but it's bad because they can't match the energy and creativity as they did in their younger years. Sure, Surtur Rising is an awesome album (not one of their "early years" albums), but yeah, I still think that after tons of albums and the artists getting older, the aggression isn't quite there. Aggression is definitely something I like in this music. Regardless, they're an awesome band! I don't listen to them a ton, but they're definitely awesome.</p>
			<p>Having said that, I've seen AA in concert twice. I saw them many years ago, maybe even in support of their Surtur Rising album, actually. I also saw them at the end of 2022. Excellent shows!</p>

			<p>It's 2025, and not very often do I become really excited about a band. I randomly picked this song to listen to from the /metal subreddit. I was quite blown away! The very beginning starts out with an explosion right in your face with a bit of brutal, groovy chaos. It actually sounds like a similar beginning to a track from Blood Incantation's "Hidden History of the Human Race". Anyway, they're a new death metal band that are reminiscent of an old school death metal band. I've literally only listened to one song so far, "Breaking the Barriers of Hope", but I <i>dig</i> it! I need to listen to more, for sure lol. They just barely released their first album a few weeks ago (from writing this + finding them), so I have my work cut out for me!</p>
			<p>They're fairly standard death metal with a bit of a cavernous sound. They also have a little bit of technicality, but clearly focus on composition rather than technicality. It's really fun to listen to! They have a lot of lead guitar soloing as well, which is a bit surprising these days; I don't pay as much attention to solos as I used to, so right now, it feels kinda refreshing!</p>

The vocalist uses harsh vocals, but he also uses exceptionally fast phrasing, which is essentially a speed-rapping cookie monster. Not only are all of the instruments machine gun fast, but the vocals are too! They're a very fun band full of humor and character. </p>

			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>These guys became one of my favorite bands around 2019~. I had recently found Blood Incantation's album "Hidden History of the Human Race", which diverted me from a death metal interest toward technical death metal. Archspire had recently released an INCREDIBLE album, "Relentless Mutation", which blew me away. I think that one reason why I like their music is because it's exceptionally fast and technical, but they also have evident melody and memorable songs - the songs don't simply blend into each other like a lot of death metal bands. With such extreme music, that can definitely happen - you end up with a wall of sound that results in iconic moments, but not memorable *songs*. </p>
			<p>I started liking this band so much that I created my own merch! They had a piece of merch which was a baseball jersey with their logo on it. I liked it a lot, and decided to make my own!</p>
			<p>One reason why I became so interested in this band is because of one of their guitar players' YouTube channels, Dean Lamb. Like I mentioned before, the band has a lot of humor and character, and Dean certainly embodies that. I really liked their music before I found his channel, so I was already oriented towards this direction of metal, but also being exposed to their culture and personality undoubtedly shifted them to the forefront. They'd be at the forefront because of their music, regardless, but afterall, knowing the character of a band and its members is part of the allure. In fact, Dean and the vocalist Oli made a video where Oli shared his famous "Friends with Bennies" recipe. I learned how to make it, and it's awesome! It's a breakfast/brunch dish with a croissant, egg, prosciutto, topped with mango & jalapenos and a delicious, minty hollandaise sauce.</p>

			<p>Blood Incantation is a death metal band from Denver, Colorado, formed in 2011. They have an old school, groovy style, but they add in progressive and technical personality. Their lyrical themes often revolve around space and death. They're similar to Vastum and Spectral Voice (two members are also in Spectral Voice), but are extra technical. Their music is aggressive and groovy, but it's also interesting. They're a fairly trippy band who like to think about existential ideas like aliens and death, and that's reflected in their music. Their songs are generally longer (not always), and their albums seem to be best listened to from start to finish.</p>
			<p>I found Blood Incantation after listening to the Vastum / Spectral Voice split EP. They had just released the album "Hidden History of the Human Race", so it was serendipitous that I found Vastum and Spectral Voice. I fell in love with that album and listened to it for a solid 3-4 weeks (I added in "Starspawn" eventually, as well). These 3 bands - Vastum, Spectral Voice, and Blood Incantation - really oriented me toward technical death metal; especially Blood Incantation. I already liked old school death metal - Dhwesha was a band that I was very very fond of - so these 3 very much-so captured me. They had a slightly trippy and more modern take to the OSDM vibe, which was great. I also very much like that their vocals and mix is very cavernous - it gives the music a depth and often facilitates a more intriguing listen, like they're onto "something" supernatural and trying to channel it toward you.</p>
			<p>"Hidden History of the Human Race" is definitely a monumental album for modern metal, in my opinion. It's certainly one to put in the history books! </p>

			<div class="band-card-description">
			<p>Bloodbath is a supergroup from Sweden. They started with Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth on vocals, Dan Swanö of Edge of Sanity (and many others) on drums then guitar, Anders "Blakkheim" Nyström of Katatonia on guitar, and Jonas Renkse of Katatonia on bass. Eventually Martin Axenrot came in to do drums - he eventually joined Opeth to replace Martin Lopez.</p>
			<p>These guys are awesome. They definitely sound like one of Dan Swanö's projects, but with an extra, special sauce. There seems to be a bit more "oomph" and "deathiness" to them. They seem to have a very powerful sound. When they had Åkerfeldt on vocals, they were unbelievable. They are still unbelievable, in fact, their album "Survival of the Sickest" was released in 2022 and is phenomenal. I particularly like the song "Born Infernal", linked below. I haven't followed these guys terribly closely, but consider they're a "supergroup", they've actually 'come into their own' to be a legit band, not just a cool side-project of disparate musicians. I think that this 2022 album might be evidence of that. It's not like they've had a revolving door of iconic musicians come and go, too. The bassist and guitarist have both remained from the beginning, and Martin Axenrot on drums joined only a few years after the band was founded. </p>
			<p>In the early years with Swanö, the guitars definitely had that Swedish Gothenburg tone. Eventually they've pulled away from that, and this "Survival of the Sickest" album sounds reminiscent of that style, but a bit more "updated" and less "pidgeon-holed" guitar personality. I like Dan Swanö, so hopefully that doesn't sound like a bad thing. That guitar tone he used was very iconic, though, so if you're not in the mood for it, it's not ideal.</p>

			<p>Bölzer are a Swiss death metal band that really made a mark on the "scene" around the mid-2010's. I think that they're a death metal band, but perhaps it's more accurate to say "extreme metal". They don't fall into a category very easily. There are certainly black metal-esque aspects to their music; the drumming can be reminiscent of some black metal, and the guitars are sometimes very tremolo-oriented, again reminiscent of black metal. I'd still put them in the category of death metal. I'd say they have a very metallic sound. The higher-ranged riffs have a very clangy and metallic sound.</p>
			<p>They've mainly released shorter EPs and only one album entitled Hero (as of right now). They're interesting because it's only 2 guys - a drummer and a vocalist/guitarist. Apparently he plays a 10-string guitar, so he's able to get the really low of a bass and also standard guitar sound. They have a pretty aggressive, chaotic, and dissonant sound. I suppose that's a result of one guitarist filling so many roles - his style grew to fill a large amount of "space" as one person. I don't necessarily mean that he's replacing multiple instruments/musicians with one person, but it's something along those lines. </p>
			<p>For that time, they were pretty unique in sound. With the style of the guitar and the blurring of lines between death and black metal, they produce a nice atmosphere. I'd say that the guitars and vocals are what make them unique. His vocals are mainly harsh and death-y, but he also moves over into clean shouts and shrieks from time to time. If you see them perform live, he also does a "Lemmy" type thing, where he tilts his head back with the mic above him. It's a bit crazy :). Playing a guitar with so many strings while simultaneously singing makes for an interesting sound. Again, he's producing lows and also higher-range melodies all at the same time (see live video for example).</p>
			<p>For the perfect example of their style is the first 1~ min of "Entranced by the Wolfshook" video below. It's impressive how only two people can make such strong and powerful music live!</p>

			<p>I would say that Cannibal Corpse is the ultimate death metal band. They're HEAVY, BRUTAL, and tenured. They started in the 90's, were one of the pioneers of the genre, and have maintained their power over the decades. Many bands fall off or chill out as they get older, but Cannibal Corpse, if anything, are getting better as they age. </p>
			<p>I don't have a lot to say about Cannibal Corpse aside from what I already said. They're consistent (in a good way), powerful, and legends. They're known for their exceptionally gorey themes and lyrics. For example, a few of their song names are "I Cum Blood", "Stripped, Raped, and Strangled", and "Hammer Smashed Face".</p>
			<p>A few amazing highlights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cannibal Corpse made an appearance in the movie "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". Jim Carrey is a big death metal fan, and he decided to include them in a scene. It's amazing.</li>
				<li>The singer, George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher, is famous for two things: 1) he has the thickest neck out there, and 2) he's a huge World of Warcraft fan. He has a tattoo on his right elbow of the symbol of the Horde. It's on his elbow so that as he holds the microphone up to his mouth, the tattoo is visible to the crowd.</li>
				<li>The bassist (and original member), Alex Webster, brings amazing technicality to the band. His technical musicianship and knowledge is very deep, it's impressive. I find this interesting because it's easy to think of metal (or death metal) as mindless caveman music, but there are some <i>incredibly talented</i> musicians out there.</li>

			<p>Good old death metal with some black elements. They have a slightly old school tone or feeling, but they were active through the 2000's into the 2010's. Their last album, released in 2013, is called Ritual Death Metal, which feels very apt. I found these guys randomly in 2025 while listening to a random playlist at work. Not bad!</p>
			<p>These guys are from Finland, which I find a bit interesting. My perception of Finland is that their metal isn't quite Scandinavian like Swedish death or Norwegian black... my perception is that Finnish bands are a bit unique and funky (it's hard to explain), almost like they don't really follow genre lines very strictly. These guys seem pretty straightforward ritualistic and culty death, true to their name and album names! It's very, very solid death.</p>

			<p>The early music from Decapitated is <i>incredible</i>!</p>
			<p>Here's the story:<br/>Two brothers started the band in the 90's, Vogg (guitarist) and Vitek (drummer). They wrote their first (and BEST) album when they were 15 and 12, respectively. Their first album, Winds of Creation, was released in the year 2000. It's one of my favorite albums! What's insane, is that the entire band were a bunch of teenagers when they recorded this album... I can't even fathom how amazing that is, considering I learned music as a kid, as well. This album included one of <i>the best</i> metal covers of all time; they covered Slayer's "Mandatory Suicide".</p>
			<p>Now... here is where tragedy strikes. In their early 20's, they were in a car accident. Vitek died and the vocalist fell into a coma. The band disbanded after this tragedy for many years.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Vogg wanted to resurrect the band after quite a few years. They're making music again and it's pretty good. I'm not as big of a fan of their music since the early two albums. I'm not too sure why, but it feels a bit too modern and not as brutal or old school. </p>
			<p>I just saw them live about a week ago. Vogg fuckin rips on guitar so hard! They put on an entertaining show, for sure. It has slightly inspired me to check out more of their later music, for sure.</p>

			<p>Einherjer is a Viking metal band from Haugesund, Norway, founded in 1993. Their lyrics retell Norse legends, and each of their albums has its own theme. They use a mixture of both harsh and clean vocals - albums stick to one vocal style.</p>
			<p>Einherjer were a crucial band for me. My friend Florian from Germany showed me their album "Odin Owns Ye All". It's one of my favorite albums! It's one of their most viking metal-esque albums. They use clean vocals and have tasty melodies and riffs. In fact, this album contains the BEST viking metal song ever created: "Out of Ginnungagap". </p>
			<p>This album is what broke the barrier of harsh vocals for me. When I was a teenager, I stuck to classic rock and 80's metal. I was critical of harsh vocals and extreme metal. I loved that "Odin Owns Ye All" album so much that I wanted to hear more music like it! I explored their other albums (that they had at the time), and I found that they used a lot of harsh vocals. I didn't like it at first, but I was such a huge fan of the band that I listened to it anyway! They did have some songs on "Blot" and "Dragons of the North" that I particularly liked. I wouldn't listen to a lot of the songs, but I'd skip to ones that I did like. Having said that, I VERY MUCH like their early EPs, namely "Aurora Borealis" and "Far Far North". Those seemed to be a bit more similar to "Odin Owns Ye All", in that they weren't quite as aggressive; they seemed to be a blend of "Odin Owns..." and their other albums with harsh vocals. </p>
			<p>After listening to their harsh vocals, I started finding a few black metal bands here and there - particularly "Immortal" - which I eventually started consuming voraciously. </p>

			<p>So I found a TV series called "The Last Kingdom". It's about the attempted formation of England by King Alfred in the 900's~. A key theme is the strife between the invading Vikings and the native Saxons. The theme song (and other music) was <i>incredible</i>. Apparently, it was written by an artist named Eivør. It's a favorite show, awesome music, and an incredibly good time! Despite my love of the show, I didn't bother listening to any of her music aside from the show's theme song.</p>
			<p>Several years after watching the show, I was buying tickets to see Decapitated. <i>Coincidentally</i> &#45; purely by chance &#45; I scrolled on the webpage and saw that Eivør would be coming to the same venue a week prior! This was about a week in the future (after the day I was looking for Decapitated tickets), so I bought tickets and went. I wasn't sure what to expect since I'd only heard her music for "The Last Kingdom", but I was excited. Long story short, it was a lot more electronic, synthy, atmospheric, and energetic, than I thought!</p>
			<p>After that, I obsessively listened to her most recent album that had come out in 2024. For at least two weeks, I essentially only listened to that album and a few other fun tracks. It was <i>amazing</i>. She's from the Faroe Islands and incorporates a lot of funky gutteral noises that sound very Viking-esque. It's an awesome blend!</p>

			<div class="band-card-description">
			<p>Enslaved is a black/progressive metal band from Bergen, Norway. They started with the other 2nd wave of black metal bands in Norway, like Immortal and Burzum. They didn't get involved in the satanic side of that scene, but seemed to kind of do their own thing and focus on more viking themes. They're not viking metal, but that's very much part of their theme. They started very raw and aggressive, like most black metal in that scene, but they had an extra "special something". They are a very atmospheric band, which contributes to their "progressiveness" that they have these days. That certainly came out in their early, raw music. They focused on the heritage and viking side of things, which I like.</p>
			<p>Eventually they moved into a more blatantly progressive direction. In fact, starting with their first EP, it seems like each album became slightly more progressive - meaning less aggressive and more atmospheric and calm. It took a few albums to get there, but I think that's the case. They remain very black metaly into the 2020's, but I think that the album Isa or Ruun in the mid-2000's marked a fairly distinct difference compared to the black metal emphasis. </p>
			<p>I personally prefer their earlier music, particularly their first EP, "Hordanes Land". They clearly played long, atmospheric, and progressive music compared to other bands in the early 90's, but this EP also had the incredible and raw aggression to it! I love this EP. Their subsequent album, Vikingligr Veldi is definitely solid, and the follow-up album to that, Frost, is one of my favorites.</p>
			<p>When I first heard the song "Fenris" off of their Frost album, I had one of the biggest grins on my face! The introduction is INCREDIBLE. It starts with some type of poem in Norwegian, then they move into this crunchy guitar riff. It's one of my favorite riffs! I seriously couldn't stop smiling when I heard the song, it literally put a huge smile on my face!</p>

			<p>Epica is a Dutch symphonic metal band. They've also been described to have gothic tendencies. They have an enthralling thrashy/deathy/blacky side to them, as well. They have a nice mixture of both clean and harsh vocals. The main vocalist, Simone Simons, is a female singer who sings cleanly, sometimes with an operatic style. The harsh vocals are performed by the band's founder and guitarist, Mark Jansen. They started in the early 2000's and have had a fairly stable lineup.</p>
			<p>I knew of Epica for many years, but never paid much attention - they always flew under my radar. In my early years, I didn't like harsh vocals, and it also took me several bands and several years before the higher-range female vocals captured me. I listened to Nightwish a little bit when I was younger, but they weren't aggressive enough for me. It seems like Epica is a much more aggressive version of Nightwish. They use good amount of harsh vocals, more extreme drumming and aggressive guitar riffs, which I like. The similarities would be the orchestral parts, plus the operatic vocals + female frontwoman.</p>
			<p>I coincidentally found these guys. My brother miraculously found Sabaton and wanted to see them live. Well, the next time Sabaton ventured here, they toured with Epica! Epica opened and put on an awesome show. I expected something more similar to Nightwish, but I was PLEASANTLY surprised when they showed the more aggressive side. That show was awesome, and I actually preferred Epica's performance! </p>
			<p>All of the songs below were played at that live show with Sabaton. They actually ended with "Consign to Oblivion", where they prompted us to get a wall of death going! It had been several years since I'd been to a show (ie: the famous covid pandemic of 2020), and it had been even longer since I'd moshed or been in a wall of death. So, naturally, I handed my beer to my brother and pushed forward to the pit lol. It was a good time!</p>

			<p>I actually found Guttural Slug through a student who I used to coach! He was one of my students throughout his teenage years and eventually started getting into metal. Eventually he started getting into music by playing drums and vocals. He liked the really extreme bands that use different extreme vocal styles. After he grew out of the rock climbing program, we exchanged numbers and would share awesome metal back and forth. Eventually, he randomly found Guttural Slug through Spotify and shared it with me. At this point in time (when writing this), I'm not a huge fan of them, but their one song, "Eyes of Abomination", is absolutely incredible!

			<div class="band-card-description">
			<p>I think that there is substantial evidence to prove that Iron Maiden are the greatest band ever. Let me give a brief synopsis, then I'll explain why. Iron Maiden started as a New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) band with their debut album Iron Maiden in 1980. They've been going strong since, releasing 17 albums and continuing to tour in their 60's. Over their career, they've transitioned into more of a progressive rock/metal band.</p>
			<p>I think that they're the greatest band for a few simple reasons:
			<ul>
				<li>Longevity - they started back in the mid-late 70's and are still touring and releasing music, 40+ years later.</li>
				<li>Influence - countless, countless bands of many rock and metal genres cite Iron Maiden as an influence.</li>
				<li>Iconic - they're galloping riffs, soaring legato solos, matching vocals, and even imagery (Eddie) make them iconic.</li>
				<li>Success - at this point in time, they've sold countless albums, travel around the world on an Iron Maiden jet, and even have a whole line of various beers. I'm not talking about them being rich, but rather they're not just musicians. They're businessmen who have built a brand on top of their music.</li>
				<li>Member consistency - Steve Harris (bassist) is a founding member of the band, and is still the main driver. Dave Murray (guitarist) joined back in the 70's, and while not considered the founder, has essentially been with the band from the beginning. Nicko (drummer) has stayed with the band since '83, and Janick Gers (guitarist) has been with the band since 1990. Bruce (singer) and Adrian (guitar) were part of the "glory days" in the 80's who helped build the brand, both took a 10~ year hiatus during the 90's, then came back and have stayed with the band ever since. There are only 4 former members of Iron Maiden over 40 years, Dennis Stratton (guitarist), Paul Di'Anno (vocals), Blaze Bayley (vocals), and Clive Burr (drummer). It's unbelievably rare for a band to have such dedication in its members, especially over so many decades!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>My personal story:<br />Iron Maiden are kind of considered to be my favorite band. I don't listen to them much anymore - my taste has grown so I listen to a lot of extreme metal. However, something about Maiden captured me when I was younger. The first song I heard of theirs was "Two Minutes to Midnight" back in 9th grade. I liked it, but I didn't really have money or means to acquire my own music - my friend showed me the song on his MP3 player (back when MP3 players were first invented). I kind of liked it, but wasn't infatuated yet. I eventually received a burned CD of their greatest hits. I remember hearing "Rainmaker" and thinking that they were too heavy for me lol. That's one of their only songs with double-bass drumming. What captured me was the vocals, their interesting melodies, and their energy. </p>

			<p>Jinjer is a type of djenty, progressivey, metalcorey band from Ukraine. They started back in 2008 and were very hardcore-esque. As time moved on, they've moved in a more progressive and death metaly direction. They have a female frontwoman, Tatiana Shmailyuk, who sings clean and growls. Her growls are very impressive and ferocious, despite no formal training.</p>
			<p>Jinjer really exploded in the late 2010's. Around that time, many YouTube creators were making "reaction" videos. Usually, the creator would be a classical opera singer, a music composer, or professional musician of some kind. They would watch videos and give their real-time reaction. Well... I personally think that most were "real-time" reactions (they seem obviously contrived and planned reactions). Anyway, TONS of these videos were created for Jinjer's song "Pisces". Jinjer released a live play-through video that had very artistic aesthetics, and the introduction is calm and gentle. Then, she starts the harsh vocals, and every creator lost their minds. These types of videos really exploded Jinjer.</p>
			<p>The reaction videos may have helped Jinjer, but they are not only a result of YouTube hype. Their music is very good as well, Tatiana's clean voice is quite pleasing, and her growls are monstrous. On top of that, the instrumentation is excellent, as well. They started as a hardcore band, which is fairly "dumb guy" type of music, but they always had a little touch of intricate "something". They were growing and gaining notoriety on their own, but the YouTube phenomenon definitely helped maximize the explosion, so to speak.</p>
			<p>I definitely like their later music. Their earlier music was very core-y, which is okay, but the later stuff that's more death metaly and progressive is very nice. One of my favorite formats to listen to is the official recording of their 2018 performance at Resurrection Fest (linked below). They played the earlier "core-y" songs, but since they were live, they had an extra "oomph" of aggression and heaviness, which I very much like!</p>
			<p>For me personally, I think that I was drawn to Jinjer because of that live performance, which I saw first, but also the juxtaposition between the harsh and clean vocals. Since I got into Opeth, that's become a very attractive vocal style for me. Her growls are quite impressive, despite being a small woman.</p>

			<p>In the late 2010's, a friend linked me to Otava Yo, a Russian folk band. Somehow, YouTube also suggested Neuromonakh since I listened to Otava Yo so much. I listened to the first song listed below, and it was awesome! It was humorous with the random bear, plus the mix of heavy-ish electro music (with deep bass) and the folk instruments was captivating! The second video below is *very* interesting. It actually has a very djenty sound to it! It's almost like a folk metal song, actually, with the drums and djenty guitar. The entire album it comes from is incredible. The vocalist even has a little phrase that includes a harsh vocal style, it's really cool. These guys would be awesome to see live.</p>
			<p>I particularly like how deep the bass is in their music. They have nice melody, which is characteristic of that folk instrument he plays, but then they have the really deep rhythm. It's awesome!</p>

Karl started Nile back in the 90's, and the albums have simply gotten better and better over time! A few days ago, my buddy asked for my recommendations of the 'most brutal death metal out there'. I went straight to Cannibal Corpse and Nile. </p>
				<p>I think that the main trait of Nile is mixing technical speed with brutality. The guitar work is technical, but also deep and brutal. The drumming - by George Kolias (from Greece) - is unprecedentedly fast with brutal double bass</p>
				<p>When I initially started listening to Nile, I was a bit torn. The albums I happened to find were their earlier/intermediate works (let's call them). They clearly had their iconic speed and sound, but they also mixed in the ultra heavy parts, where the tempo slows down and drags on, even though the drums or tremolo picking may be lightning fast. It's peculiar how that can happen - tons of notes are blazing by, but the composition feels really heavy and dragging. I didn't like the dragging parts, but I tolerated them because of the other faster, "headbang-able" parts. I've listened to them for many years, so I retain that stance, but I perhaps they've expanded their discography such that I can listen to the "non-dragging" albums enough to not get bothered. </p>
				<p>Anyway, I remember when I was a carpet installer in my early 20's. This is when I found Nile and became <i>obsessed</i> with the album "Annihilation of the Wicked", particularly the title track. I played that track on repeat hundreds of times, it was amazing! The main riff with the melodic bends with the galloping behind it and headbangable doulbe bass all combined together is perfect!</p>
				<p>One last note: Karl Sanders also does backing vocals. The primary vocalist always has some of the best death metal vocals, but the fact that Karl adds in the droning gutterals adds some nice variety. His vocals aren't amazing or anything, but I think the fact that it adds a small amount of variation is really nice.</p>

			<p>Spectral Voice is a Death metal band from Denver, Colorado, formed in 2012. The band seems like it might be a side-project of the Blood Incantation guitarists. In fact, this band is like a doomy version of Blood Incantation. The vocals are cavernous, the guitars are groovy and chompy, but they also have interesting melodies with the guitars. </p>
			<p>I found these guys when I listened to the split EP they did with Vastum. In fact, since the guitarists are also in Blood Incantation, that's the connection that started me down the path of technical death metal. I like these guys for the same reasons that I like Blood Incantation and Vastum - they're groovy, cavernous, chompy, and fairly technical. I'd say that the doomy parts that really slow down aren't my cup of tea, but they're absolutely excellent aside from that!</p>

			<p>This band was suggested to me by my old rock climbing student, Matt. These guys so far only have one full-length album, Republik Rakyat Jelata, but it's sensational. It is relentless, brutal, and doesn't have a single negative aspect. If I need something that feels brutal as if it's angry, but it's not actually angry. Apparently, Sufism is a religious ideology. </p>

			<p>Apparently the album "...talks about nation which where the band and label [are] living in. Not only about nation, this album is also about bringing up national cultural pride."<br />I respect that.</p>

			<p>Thou is an American sludge metal band formed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2005. Thou's style has been labeled as "experimental doom", stoner metal and sludge metal. On the band's style, AllMusic critic Gregory Heaney stated that "the band's sound blends the shuddering heaviness of doom with the oppressive atmospherics of black metal, giving the band a monolithic sound that feels, at times, inescapable.</p>
			<p>I was suggested these guys from a friend who does not like metal at all. I think that he was having a rough time in life and went through a whole black metal phase for a while. These guys aren't black metal, but they're definitely heavy and atmospheric! I really like their black metal-type vocals. Sludge metal isn't really my 'thing', but there's definitely some that is pretty decent. The song linked below has a mid-tempo chug that's really catchy. It's heavy and doomy, but with enough tempo to not drag. I also think that part of the reason why I like the song is because of the title. It's definitely attention-catching! </p>

			<p>Vastum is a death metal band from San Francisco. They have an old school death metal vibe, mixed with a "cavernous" feeling. Their sound reminds me of a monster in the caverns - they have an echo-y element to their sound and vocals that make it sound like they're blasting something evil from deep inside the earth, or something. They're a death metal band, but they keep their tempos a bit slower (not "doom" slow, though), which makes them very groovy and headbangable.</p>
			<p>I found out that they have a main vocalist who does the low gutterals, but their female guitarist Leila also contributes to higher-end vocals, as well. I remember learning that and was very impressed! My taste in death growls, for a long time, definitely catered towards the deeper, heavier voice that males usually create. Her gutterals are higher-pitched than the main vocalist, but they didn't put me off - they are still fairly low and complement the deeper gutterals very well! I've grown to like more variety in my vocals over the years, so I very much like and appreciate this small bit of variety that she brings.</p>
			<p>I randomly found their split EP with Spectral Voice on YouTube in the late 2010's. Their old school and groovy vibe hit me immediately, it was incredible! I've always liked the headbangable metal; music with a more definitive and human tempo than some black metal, thrash, and death metal. I feel like it's not just mindless headbanging as fast as you can, but that there's a bit more human feeling to the music since humans can more comfortably move with the music. It's perhaps ironic that I say that since I described them as sounding like a cavernous monster lol. Either way, they're exceptional!</p>
			<p>After finding Vastum, that put me in the path towards finding Blood Incantation and eventually Archspire; it also started my trajectory towards a definitive preference for technical death metal.</p>

			<p>I randomly found these guys in a YouTube playlist while working. There is a section of their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU55nLyG2oU" target="_blank">Cronus</a> that I became <i>completely</i> obsessed with (2:40 into the track). I believe they're considered something like post-black metal.</p>
			<p>These guys are Ukranian. This is a bit interesting right now because we <i>still</i> have the "war" going on between Ukraine and Russia. The band formed in 2012, and I believe a lot of conflict between these two countries started in 2014. So, I wonder if there's some influence there. Additionally, over the past decade or so, a lot of really good metal has come out of Eastern Europe, like Jinjer, MGLA, Batushka, and so forth. </p>
			<p>I also think I really like the saxophone. I think that it's really interesting when bands <i>effectively</i> include instruments and elements that are atypical for metal or rock. I think it works very well. However, it's become a little bit of a trope or fad right now. There are other bands like Rivers of Nihil who have also included the saxophone. It's also cool, but I think that I personally like it when it's there for a reason instead of being included for the sake of a trend or fad. </p>

			<p>Wilderun is like cinematic metal. Right now, that's my characterization of their sound. I was listening to a YouTube playlist with proggy and technical death metal in mid-2025. Randomly, their track "Distraction III" popped up in the playlist. I was completely blown away! Here's what I said about it to some metal buddies:</p>
			<p><i>I'm not quite sure how to describe or characterize this next song...</i> </p>

			<p><i>It's like... If you like movie soundtracks, you may definitely like this.</i> </p>

			<p><i>If you like orchestral music, you may appreciate this.</i> </p>

			<p><i>If you like prog music, you'll likely get jiggy with it.</i> </p>

			<p><i>If you like a nice, solid crescendo, you'll like this.</i> </p>

			<p><i>If you like choral music (like in cinema soundtracks), you may be interested in this as a crossover.</i> </p>

			<p><i>If I were to create a church or religion or something, I think I'd want this type of song to be the essence of the belief system. It'd be the Liturgy song, but either looped a few times or maybe extended to be like 10+ mins.</i></p>
			<p>I started listening to more of their music and they're kind of like a version of Opeth with more power metal or symphonic metal influences. Some tracks are badass and death metal-y, and others are soft, ballad-esque. </p>
